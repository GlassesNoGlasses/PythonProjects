# What is This?

### Listen, there are only 2 reasons for you being here:

#### 1. You like anime/manga; hello my closet weeb 🎭
#### 2. You're a recruiter; in which case please hire me 🙏

Anyways, the idea for these projects can be described by the following situation:

Have you ever found an amazing series, TV show, movie, etc., had an amazing time enjoying it, and soon realize that the series you've been binging is finished and you still have leftover snacks and cravings for more? That's what this is for, except for anime and manga.

The goal is to design a custom anime/manga reccomendation algorithm based on the users preferences.

## Ongoing Projects:
- Manga Reccomendation: ET July 10
- Anime Reccomendation: ET: July 15
